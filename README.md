# kisbot
kisbot package for publishing RSSI data from kismet, spectools, wireless-tools, etc. as a ROS topic
Ideally this would be used with a spectrum analyzer like the Wi-Spy from Metageek. 

I haven't worked on this in a few years, so it's mostly an example of how to write a ROS node for something that is completely
NOT a typical piece of robotic hardware.
